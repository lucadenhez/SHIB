# SHIB

This website is for viewing the price of the ***Shiba Inu Altcoin!*** The design of this website is alike Robinhood's, but it looks better. Much pretty, shiny stonks. And of course this website has *SHIB* unalike Robinhood.

# Viewing

This code was made for a 1920x1080 (16:9) display in Chrome's fullscreen, so I could watch my Shiba's go to the moon while I do other things. This may work great on other sizes/resolutions, but thing's may look very off such as the logo. I'm learning about responsive web design right now, so heopfully I can improve it soon.
