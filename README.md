# SHIB

This website is for viewing the price of the ***Shiba Inu Altcoin!*** The design of this website is alike Robinhood's, but it looks better. Much pretty, shiny stonks. And of course this website has *SHIB* unalike Robinhood.

# Features

* Balance calculator
* Balance autosave
* Price auto-update every 10 seconds
* Four currencies (USD, GBP, CAD, and EUR)
* More to come...

# Viewing

This wesbite will work best on a 1920x1080 (16:9) display in Chrome's fullscreen, but it works on any device. I like to have it in the background, watching my Shiba's go to the moon while I do other things. **Cheers to michael86 for adding responsive web design! This makes the experience so much more enjoyable.**
